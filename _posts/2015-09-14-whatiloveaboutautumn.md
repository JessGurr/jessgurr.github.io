## What I love about Autumn
 
There's nothing better than to go out on a really chilly, crisp Autumn morning, wrapped up in warm clothes, cup of steaming coffee in hand (there's a bit of a coffee theme going on here :smirk:) and walking to work through all the crunchy, brightly coloured leaves that litter the floor. 

You can definitely feel that things are changing. The air and light are different; there's a whisper of bitterness in the wind; the nights are drawing in once again, preparing us for winter. That and now the summer holidays are over, the kids are back in school.

I never really liked school that much, but one of my favourite memories of going back for a new term was being taken to pick out a new school bag and all the stationery ãƒ¼ I'm a bit of a stationery fiend :pencil2: :black_nib: :straight_ruler: :notebook:.

Below are 10 things that I absolutely love about the season and think make it really special:

1. Crisp, cold mornings
2. Stomping through all the crunchy leaves :maple_leaf: :fallen_leaf: :leaves:
3. The amazing colours everywhere
4. Wrapping up warm in a nice coat, scarf and hat etc
5. Hot drinks
6. Wearing chunky boots and loads of layers
7. Snuggling up on the sofa with a blanket and the Boy, with a nice fire going and some films
8. Making soup
9. The fact that it's nearly my birthday (and bonfire night!)
10. Planning for Christmas

In the next few weeks, I plan on taking the Boy and my camera to our local [Arboretum](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/westonbirt) to get some shots of the amazing trees and foliage. Everything is absolutely beautiful there this time of year.

It may be pouring with rain today, but I look forward to the next time I'm out in the yellowish light of an Autumnal sun, feeling the cold prickle my cheeks and anticipating all the exciting things to come - lots of birthdays (including mine!), Christmas, and the promise of a new year.
