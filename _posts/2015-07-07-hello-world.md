Hello, world! It's nice to meet you. 

I'm trying my hand at blogging with Jekyll - this is my shiny new website that @daviddarnes very kindly sorted for me with his amazing Spidey (read: web) skills. Get it? 

It's using a very nice Jekyll template called [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) by @mdo

Here are some of the things I'm looking at getting stuck into in the near future:

<!--more-->

- Blogging on a regular basis
- How to use markdown (I hear it's all the rage on GitHub :wink:)
- A little bit more about using GitHub
- Finding out how Jekyll works
- Putting up some examples of my Copywriting work for you to have a look at

Wish me luck and come back soon! There'll be more where this came from...
