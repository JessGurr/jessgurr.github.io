**WebDevConf is a conference based in Bristol dedicated to all things 'web' including design, development, companies and technology. Run by Alex Older, it's a showcase of skills and expertise, and a chance to learn new ways of working.**

Last Friday was the 2015 conference and I was happy to be able to attend along with Dave and some friends, both from Bristol and further afield. I'm not a web developer, nor do I claim to be - I have to say, there are certain things that are a little over my head discussed at these events - however, every year I've been, I've glaned so much from the speakers that it really is beneficial. Whether it's direct teaching or even just reading between the lines of what is being said, I've put into practise things such as improving productivity, using your creativity in new ways, overcoming negativity and fear of doing things, and of course, new web techniques. 

This year was a little less inspiring than the last. Whether that's down to a lack of [Gav Strange](http://www.jam-factory.com/)'s [talk](https://twitter.com/jessicagurr/status/520639973125799937) or a [crazy intro from Keir](https://youtu.be/AV4YNfJflmI), I'm not sure. The group I was with (all devs of some form or another) unanimously agreed that they'd have preferred some more technical elements in there.
