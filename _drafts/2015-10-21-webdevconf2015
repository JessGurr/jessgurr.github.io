**WebDevConf is a conference based in Bristol dedicated to all things 'web' including design, development, companies and technology. Run by Alex Older, it's a showcase of skills and expertise, and a chance to learn new ways of working.**

Last Friday was the 2015 conference and I was happy to be able to attend along with Dave and some friends, both from Bristol and further afield. I'm not a web developer, nor do I claim to be - I have to say, there are certain things that are a little over my head discussed at these events - however, every year I've been, I've glaned so much from the speakers that it really is beneficial. Whether it's direct teaching or even just reading between the lines of what is being said, I've put into practise things such as improving productivity, using your creativity in new ways, overcoming negativity and fear of doing things, and of course, new web techniques. 

This year was a little less inspiring than the last. Whether that's down to a lack of [Gav Strange](http://www.jam-factory.com/)'s [talk](https://twitter.com/jessicagurr/status/520639973125799937) or a [crazy intro from Keir](https://youtu.be/AV4YNfJflmI), I'm not sure. The group I was with (all devs of some form or another) unanimously agreed that they'd have preferred some more technical elements in there. With no time for questions, despite an early finish, it seemed a little rushed. That said, it was a great chance to hear some interesting opinions, learn some things and hang out with likeminded people. I hope to put some of it all into action both on a personal level and at work (if they'll have it!).

I especially enjoyed Luke Murphy Wearmouth's [talk on typography](https://speakerdeck.com/lurkmoophy/designing-for-words-elements-of-typographic-style-for-the-web) -  we all decided this was the best and most informative talk of the day. 

The **speakers** for the day were: 

- [Luke Murphy-Wearmouth](http://twitter.com/lurkmoophy) - _Designing for Words: Elements of Typographic Style for the Web_
- [Melinda Seckington](http://twitter.com/mseckington) - _The Marvel Guide for Developers_
- [George Crawford](http://twitter.com/georgeocrawford) - _Putting the Art Into Article_
- [Adam Onishi](http://twitter.com/onishiweb) - _Trophy Winning Teams_

- [Paul Davis](http://twitter.com/pauladamdavis) - _Profesional Progression_
- [Louise Howells](http://twitter.com/supertastycake) - _Why So Serious?_


Here are my 5 top points taken from the day:

Just to sign off, I'd live to give a shoutout and thank you to [Alex Older](http://twitter.com/alexolder) for putting on WDC for another year. It's got to be pretty hard going trying to organise something like this almost single-handedly, especially with a new baby! Any comments or criticisms about the event are constructive, I hope. We'll look forward to next year!
