## What I love about Autumn

I never really liked school all that much, but one of my favourite memories of going back for a new term was going with my family to pick out a new school bag and all the stationery (I'm a bit of a stationery fiend). 

Here are 10 things that I absolutely love about the Autumn and that I think make it really special:

1. Crisp, cold mornings
2. Stomping through all the crunchy leaves
3. The amazing colours everywhere
4. Wrapping up warm in a nice coat, scarf and hat etc
5. Hot drinks
6. Wearing chunky boots and loads of layers
7. Snuggling up on the sofa with a blanket, nice fire going and some films
8. Making soup
9. The fact that it's nearly my birthday (and bonfire night!)
10. Planning for Christmas
