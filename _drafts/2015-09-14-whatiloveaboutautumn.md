## What I love about Autumn
 
There's nothing better than to go out on a really chilly, crisp Autumn morning, wrapped up in all your warm clothes, cup of steaming coffee in hand　(there's a bit of a coffee theme going on here :smirk:) and walking to work through all the crunchy, brightly coloured leaves that litter the floor. 

You can definitely feel that things are changing. The air and light are different; there's a whisper of bitterness in the wind; the nights are drawing in once again, preparing us for winter. That and now the summer holidays are over, all the kids are back in school.

I never really liked school all that much, but one of my favourite memories of going back for a new term was going with my family to pick out a new school bag and all the stationery ー I'm a bit of a stationery fiend :pencil2: :black_nib: :straight_ruler: :notebook:. So, that really sticks out in my mind when I think of Autumn.

Below are 10 things I absolutely love about the season and that I think make it really special:

1. Crisp, cold mornings
2. Stomping through all the crunchy leaves :maple_leaf: :fallen_leaf: :leaves:
3. The amazing colours everywhere
4. Wrapping up warm in a nice coat, scarf and hat etc
5. Hot drinks
6. Wearing chunky boots and loads of layers
7. Snuggling up on the sofa with a blanket, nice fire going and some films
8. Making soup
9. The fact that it's nearly my birthday (and bonfire night!)
10. Planning for Christmas

In the next few weeks, I plan on taking the Boy and my camera to our local Arboretum to get some shots of the amazing trees and foliage there. Everything is absolutely beautiful there this time of year. xxx

It may be pouring with rain today, but I look forward to the next time I'm out in the yellowish light of an Autumnal sun, feeling the cold prickle on my cheeks and anticipating
