**I'm afraid I must apologise for my absence. Almost three months ago, I started a new job as a Content Manager at [CookiesHQ](http://www.cookieshq.com) - a software development company that specialises in the Ruby on Rails framework (amongst other things). That's been taking up a lot of my time. It turns out that not working - or should I say working as a freelancer, choosing my own working hours etc - means you get out of the 9-5:30 work habit and it takes it out of you! I've been trying to recoup a lot of sleep debt lately, which I haven't caught up on by a long shot yet, but I'm getting there.**

So, what else is new? I went blonde/silver. Quite a process, but I think it's been worth it. Brad, who does my hair and is the co-owner of [Harry Blades and Angry Daves](http://www.hbad.co.uk/) - my 'salon' of choice - is probably quite used to me turning up and wanting to do something a bit crazy with my hair, so he was more than up for the challenge. It took three and a half hours to get it to the proper shade (bleach really stings after a while!). I'm actually going back this week to go a little bit lighter, so I'm quite excited to see how that turns out. 

Dave and I have been really liking Silicon Valley. Whilst it is a little vulgar in places, it's also incredibly funny and the writers/creators have managed to get a lot of things right when it comes to the start-up world. I'm a fan of [Gimlet Media's](https://gimletmedia.com/) [Startup podcast](https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/) and have worked at a few start-up companies in my time, so you do pick up things as you go. There are many similarities that we've noticed, as the fledgling company on the show, Pied Piper, is taken from the tiny _'incubee'_ at the start of season one to whatever it may become as the show progresses. We're only on season two right now, but it shouldn't be long before we've caught up to current episodes. Give it a watch! 

There are some really well thought out characters - in particular, Erlich Bachman (played by T.J. Miller) and Peter Gregory (my favourite character, personally - portrayed by the late Christopher Evan Welch). A perfect caricature of a VC investor with all the eccentricity and quirks that come with such a role, Christopher Evan Welch, very much inhabits his character. His work was so subtle, but there are some really great moments throughout season one that had us in stitches. We were both truly saddened to hear of his passing. 

Anyway, just thought I'd check in. I will be finishing my New York series very shortly, then moving on to other things that I've got up my sleeve :). Hope you're all well. I look forward to getting things back on the road. In the meantime, I leave you with this brilliant clip from season one of SV:
