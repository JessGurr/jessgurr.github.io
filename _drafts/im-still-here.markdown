***So, it's been a while...***

**I'm afraid I must apologise for my absence. Almost three months ago, I started a new job as a Content Manager at [CookiesHQ](http://www.cookieshq.com) - a software development company that specialises in the Ruby on Rails framework (amongst other things). That's been taking up a lot of my time. It turns out that not working - or should I say working as a freelancer, choosing my hours etc - means you get out of the 9-5:30 work habit and it takes it out of you! I've been trying to recoup a lot of sleep debt lately, which isn't entirely working, but I'm getting there.**

Dave and I have been really liking Silicon Valley. Whilst it is a little vulgar in places, it's also really funny and the writers/creators have managed to get a lot of things right when it comes to the start-up world. I'm a fan of [Gimlet Media's](https://gimletmedia.com/) [Startup podcast](https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/) and have worked at a few start-up companies in my time, so you do pick up things as you go. There are many similarities that we've noticed, as the fledgling company on the show, Pied Piper, is taken from the tiny 'incubee' at the start of season one to whatever it may become. We're only on season two right now, but it shouldn't be long before we've caught up to current episodes. Give it a watch! They're quite short episodes and each season is only eight to ten episodes long. There are some really well thought out characters - in particular, Erlich Bachman (played by T.J. Miller) and Peter Gregory (my favourite character, personally - portrayed by the late Christopher Evan Welch). Peter Gregory is a perfect caricature of a VC investor, with eccentricity and quirks a plenty.
