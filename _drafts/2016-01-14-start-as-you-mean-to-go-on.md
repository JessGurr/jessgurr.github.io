It’s become rather cliche to say that come January 1st, you’re going to get fit and start eating healthier. I suppose it does go with the end of Christmas, having had all the rich and delicious things that come with the season. I’m not into New Years resolutions, as I rarely stick to them, but the one thing I did stick to for the last couple of years is getting fitter and trying to lose some weight; that is until about six months ago.

To be fair, circumstances dictated that maintaining the fitness stuff and eating healthier would be more difficult, in part due to emotional things. I won’t go into all that now. It was a bit of an excuse, as well, though and it’s something that I would like to change. 

Part of having [Hypermobility Syndrome](http://hypermobility.org/) (post on this soon) means that I have to stay fit and strong to maintain joint stability and to make sure I’m not in so much pain. As such, I want to start a plan that I’ll try my best to follow in order to keep my fitness levels up. I’m not going to be crazy hard on myself - if your body needs rest, you should listen to it. There will also be times where life is going to get in the way of this goal. Despite all that,  I want to try and become more disciplined.

Hopefully, this plan will also help me lose a bit of weight. I’m not massive and I was doing quite well over the last two years in dropping some pounds slowly (so that they stayed off) by calorie counting using the [MyFitnessPal app](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/). Slimmers World/Weight Watchers type of things and faddy diets really aren’t my bag. I like my food and enjoy cooking delicious meals. Sometimes, I can be a bit fussy - another thing I’m trying to change this year. The main element I want from my diet/doing any sports is to enjoy what I’m doing. I think that’s the key to maintaining longevity in anything you do. 

Using the MyFitnessPal app to count calories really isn’t as hard as you’d think. It daunted me a bit at first, but once you work it into your routine, it’s fairly straightforward. You can still have treats and eat a decent meal every day. I went from having 2,000 calories a day (the UK standard for a woman) to about 1,300. This helped me to steadily shed just over a stone in weight over a year and I felt really good that I’d done that way. When you take on a diet, like Slimmers World, for example, you have to keep doing that for the rest of your life to keep the weight off; through exercising regularly and lowering your calorie intake, you don’t have to feel bad about what you’re eating. If I want to have pizza one day, I just need to be a bit more careful that day or do some exercise - exercising counts towards your calorie allowance, but if you want to keep them in the bank, that’s okay. The app is really good at making sure you eat *enough* as well, because that’s something a lot of people make the mistake of when they’re dieting. Your body needs sustenance, just not all the greasy, sugary stuff all the time.

A friend of mine is also working on getting fit at the minute. I have to say, she’s a bit of an inspiration. She’s so dedicated to her fitness and makes time to do some seriously intense workouts. Spin class, then a HiiT class afterwards? Rather you than me, Z ;). I certainly do admire her ability to stick with it. She started doing this quick workout on the side that somebody showed her and I liked the idea of it. You have to take your name, look at a reference board that has an exercise assigned to each letter of the alphabet and build your own workout. Have a look at mine below:

J - 15 crunches
E - 1 min wall sit
S - 30 burpees
S - 30 burpees
I - 30 jumping jacks
C - 30 squats
A - 50 jumping jacks

A - 50 jumping jacks
M - 20 burpees
Y - 10 crunches

G - 20 sec arm curls
U - 30 sec arm curls
R - 15 push ups
R - 15 push ups

Damn all those double consonants. My name doesn’t really give the most varied of exercises, but these seem to work all the right places: arms, abs and legs. I’m going to try and build this into a week’s exercise regime that will go something like this: 

*Name game (above) - 3 to 4 times a week
*Run - once a week
*Gym - at least once a week, probably a combination of weights and running on the treadmill or rowing.
*Class - once a week
*General physio/joint exercises - at least once a day

Once the weather gets a bit less wet and slightly warmer, I will be going out to restart my parkour training, this time without a trainer. I might see if I can get together with some other people to train with. Also want to ride my bike more. All of these things I actually like doing and feel really positive about myself afterwards. Seriously missing parkour training at the minute.
